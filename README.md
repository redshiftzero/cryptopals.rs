# cryptopals.rs

Hello github adventurer, this repo has my solutions to sets 1-6 of the cryptopals challenges which I mostly wrote in 2020 while learning Rust.

Each challenge solution is in a test. Computationally expensive challenge solutions are ignored (i.e. with `#[ignore]`), so to run _all_ tests, you'll need to do `cargo test -- --ignored`.
